In Node.js, modules are reusable blocks of code that encapsulate related functionalities. 
Each file in Node.js is a module, and Node uses CommonJS module system by default.

There are 3 main types of modules:

Core Modules (built-in): Provided by Node.js, like fs, http, path.
Local Modules (user-defined): Custom modules created by you.
Third-party Modules: Installed using npm (Node Package Manager), like express, mongoose.
