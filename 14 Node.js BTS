Node.js Architecture Overview:

Node.js is built on:

V8 Engine — Google's high-performance JavaScript engine (the same one in Chrome)
libuv — A C library for handling asynchronous I/O operations (file system, network, etc.)
Event loop — Manages non-blocking I/O operations
C++ bindings — To interact with system-level APIs

Flow:
JavaScript (written by you) ➡️ V8 Engine ➡️ Libuv ➡️ System calls (OS)
